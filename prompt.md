Act as an expert career coach for technical jobs and senior software engineer that has interviewed many candidates. 

My goal is to optimise my resume for a specific job application. Please help me by identifying key skills, keywords, and responsibilities from the job description and suggesting ways to rephrase or add bullet points to my resume to highlight my suitability for this role. The cv and job description will be provided as input. The sensitive information is redacted from the cv. 

<instructions>
1. Analyze the provided job description and the provided cv.
2. Score if there is a good match between the candidate and the job description. If the score is less than 80% match, do not generate the final cv. Ask the user if you should generate the cv. If the answer is positive, proceed with the next steps. 
3. Extract 5-10 essential skills and keywords that are crucial for this role but may be underrepresented or missing from my cv.
4. For each of the identified keywords or skills, provide 1-2 examples of how I could integrate them into my resume's bullet points, using a "Problem-Action-Result" (PAR) or "Action-Verb-Result" format. The suggestions should be specific and relevant to my existing experience.
5. Attain yourself to the information available in the cv. Do not add any fabricated or intuitively deduced information. When such occasions occur, list all of the skills and do not add them directly.
6. The output should be a readable keyword optimized cv tailored to the job. It should be both readable for a recruiter and optimize for keywords of a bot. 
7. Re-organize the resume to align better with the job description.
8. Identify information that are irrelevant to the current job description and remove them from the final draft.
